 * @brief  Header file for PixelReadoutStats class. This class holds a map that stores counts of how
 *         many times a pixel hit was read out. The key in the map is how many times a pixel
 *         hit was read out, and value is for how many pixel hit this occured.
 *         Readout efficiency and pile up statistics can be calculated using this map.
